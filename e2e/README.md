## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites

Make sure your development environment is set up:
```bash
npm install
```

Ensure your database is set up and has sample data:
```bash
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:sample
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run Tests in UI Mode (Interactive)

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Run Tests in Headed Mode (Watch Browser)

```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Run Tests in Debug Mode

```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Run Specific Test File

```bash
npx playwright test sql-editor.spec.ts
```

### Run Tests Matching a Pattern

```bash
# Run all authentication tests
npx playwright test --grep "Authentication"

# Run all chart tests
npx playwright test charts.spec.ts

# Run tests with a specific name
npx playwright test --grep "login"
```

## Test Helpers

The `TestHelpers` class (`helpers/test-helpers.ts`) provides reusable utility functions:

### Authentication
- `login(email, password)` - Login to the application
- `navigateToPage(pageName)` - Navigate to specific pages

### Form Interactions
- `fillByLabel(label, value)` - Fill form fields by label
- `selectDropdown(triggerText, optionText)` - Select dropdown options
- `clickButton(text)` - Click buttons by text

### Assertions & Verification
- `verifyToast(message, type)` - Verify toast notifications
- `verifyTableHasContent(expectedMinRows)` - Verify table has data
- `verifyNoConsoleErrors()` - Check for console errors

### Editor Interactions
- `waitForMonacoEditor()` - Wait for Monaco editor to load
- `typeInMonacoEditor(text, append)` - Type in Monaco editor
- `getMonacoEditorContent()` - Get editor content

### UI Interactions
- `switchTab(tabText)` - Switch between tabs
- `waitForLoading()` - Wait for loading spinners
- `screenshot(name)` - Take screenshots
- `retry(fn, retries, delay)` - Retry operations

## Test Data

Predefined SQL queries are provided in `TEST_QUERIES`:

- `TEST_QUERIES.simple` - Basic SELECT query
- `TEST_QUERIES.join` - Simple JOIN query
- `TEST_QUERIES.complexJoin` - Complex JOIN with GROUP BY and aggregations
- `TEST_QUERIES.aggregation` - Aggregation query with GROUP BY
- `TEST_QUERIES.withSubquery` - CTE (WITH clause) query

## Configuration

Playwright is configured in `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:4050`
- **Test Directory**: `./e2e`
- **Browser**: Chromium (Desktop)
- **Timeout**: Default timeouts
- **Retries**: 2 on CI
- **Screenshots**: On failure
- **Trace**: On first retry
- **Reporter**: HTML

## Screenshots

Screenshots are automatically saved to `screenshots/` directory:
- On test failures
- When `helpers.screenshot()` is called
- For visual regression testing

## Debugging Tips

### 1. Run with UI Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```
Use the UI to:
- Watch tests run in real-time
- Inspect DOM elements
- View network requests
- Time-travel through test execution

### 2. Run in Headed Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```
Watch the browser execute tests live.

### 3. Use Debug Mode
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```
Step through tests with debugger integration.

### 4. Pause Execution
Add `await page.pause()` in your test to pause and inspect state.

### 5. Increase Timeouts
If tests are failing due to timeouts:
```typescript
await expect(element).toBeVisible({ timeout: 10000 });
```

## CI/CD Integration

Tests are configured to run in CI with:
- Automatic server startup
- Reduced parallel workers
- Retry on failure
- HTML report generation

## Best Practices

1. **Use Test Helpers**: Leverage the `TestHelpers` class for common operations
2. **Wait for Elements**: Use explicit waits instead of fixed timeouts
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear test names that describe what is being tested
4. **Independent Tests**: Each test should be able to run independently
5. **Clean State**: Tests should clean up after themselves (delete created resources)
6. **Screenshots**: Take screenshots for complex flows and on failures
7. **Assertions**: Use specific assertions for better error messages
8. **Page Objects**: Consider using page objects for complex pages

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Fail with "Data source not found"
- Ensure database migrations are run: `npm run db:migrate`
- Load sample data: `npm run db:sample`

### Tests Fail with "Authentication failed"
- Verify default credentials: `admin@admin.com` / `admin`
- Check if auth system is running

### Monaco Editor Not Found
- Wait for editor to load: `await helpers.waitForMonacoEditor()`
- Increase timeout for slow networks

### Tests Timeout
- Increase timeout in config: `timeout: 30000`
- Use `reuseExistingServer: true` in config
- Ensure dev server is running

## Contributing

When adding new tests:
1. Use the `TestHelpers` class for common operations
2. Group related tests in `describe` blocks
3. Use descriptive test names
4. Add screenshots for visual verification
5. Update this README with new coverage
